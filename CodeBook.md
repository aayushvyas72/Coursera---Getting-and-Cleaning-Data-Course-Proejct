## Information of tidy_data.txt

The first two variables in this file contains values for the subject and the activities performed by the subject.
There are six activities performed by each subject: Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, and Laying.
The rest of the 66 variables are represents the averages for the variables of some selected features, which were means ans standard deviation in th original dataset: 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0'

## Loading tidy_data.txt in R

To load the output file of code(tid_data.txt) in R, user needs to run the following code:

    tidy_data <- read.table("tidy_data.txt", header = TRUE)

## Process of generatin of tidy_data.txt

The object was to code that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code was written in a scipt run_analysis.R, it performs the above tasks as follows:

**Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set**

The data is taken from the given url, file is downloaded in working directory and different datas will be imported in different variables. It binds the files UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt, UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt, UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt by columns and UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt, UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt, UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt by columns and again binds both data frames by rows to create one merged data frame.

**Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement**

Creates one data frame 'extracteddata' which contains measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement along with 'subject' and 'activity' variables.

**Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set**

Here, the values in activity column is replaced by a factor based on levels and labels contained in the 'activity_labels' data file.

**Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names**

Here, variable names are extracted from 'features.txt', and allot it to columns of extracteddata data frame.

**Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject**

Create a new data frame 'tidy.data' by grouping extraceddata by 'subject'amd 'activity' and calculation mean of each variable, than rename each column of tidy.data to represent average of each variable.
The new file is created "tidy_data.txt" that contains tidy.data data frame.
